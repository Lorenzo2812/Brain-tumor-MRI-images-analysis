# Brain-tumor-MRI-images-analysis
Computer vision task about convolutional neural networks for the classification of brain tumor images:
Hyperparameter tuning of a convolutional neural network built from scratch to find the best combination. The best model has an accuracy of 96%. Comparison with a Pre-trained model (VGG16) performance.
